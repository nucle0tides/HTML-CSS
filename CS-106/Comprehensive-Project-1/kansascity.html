					The Kansas City Zoo is located in Kansas City, Missouri in the middle of Swope Park. The zoo was founded in the early 1900s and their first exhibit was the Bird and Carnivore house. Currently, the zoo encompasses 202 acres and is a hub for education, conservation and entertainment. The Zoo is open year-round, excluding Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years Day. You can learn more about the Kansas City Zoo <a href="http://www.kansascityzoo.org/">here</a>. A map of the Kansas City zoo can be found <a href="http://www.kansascityzoo.org/attractions/map">here</a>.

					Growing up, I went to the Kansas City Zoo a lot through school field trips and outings with my parents. One of my favorite trips was to see a special Koala exhibit that the zoo had for a limited time. During that trip, my parents bought me a koala stuffed animal that I named Candy. On another visit, there were a few leopards sleeping on a net above my head and my dad reached up and tugged on one of their little tails! My favorite exhibits at the Kansas City Zoo are the kangaroo exhibit and the big cat exhibits. The Kangaroo exhibit is set up so the kangaroos are freely roaming around. Peacocks can also be found freely roaming around as well. The meerkat exhibit is also really great because the meerkats are <em>always</em> visible. Going to see the lionesses and lions is also exciting because they will usually lay against the barrier. It makes getting images and observing them much easier. My most recent trip was in 2013 with my boyfriend and his family.

					The images on this page are from that visit. The image to the right is from the Gorilla exhibit at the Kansas City Zoo.
